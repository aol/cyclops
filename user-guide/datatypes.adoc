# Data types in cyclops-react

1. Eval : Eval represents a compuations, and can either be immediate (Eval.now), deffered (Eval.always), or deffered and cached (Eval.later).
1. Maybe : Maybe is a more powerful version of Optional, most operations except for filter and flatMap are lazy.
1. Either : Either can hold one of two values, by default we bias it to one particular type (it will behave similarly to a Maybe of that type), but we can swap the primary (active) and secondary (hidden) types. Xor can be used to accumulate validation failures via Xor.sequence or Xor.ap
1. Ior : an Inclusive Or can either hold one of two values or both. They can be sequenced in a similar manner to Xors.
1. Try : offers Java friendly functional exceptional handling
1. Future : wraps CompletableFuture to provide a more powerful extended API
1. Trampoline : is a simple implementation of the 'Trampoline' pattern which converts recusrive method calls to iterative ones
1. Reader : Reader is a lazy execution pattern for dependency injection
1. FluentFunctions : is a class for manipulating method references and functions
1. AnyM is a wrapper for Any Monad type (i.e. Stream, Optional, CompletableFuture and many of the types here - Eval, Maybe, Reader, Either, Ior, Try, Future), to subclasses AnyMSeq and AnyMValue are provided
1. ReactiveSeq is an extension to jOOÎ» Seq that implements the reactive-streams api adds in asyncrhonous and lazy stream execution
1. SimpleReact : is a builder for SimpleReact FutureStreams
1. LazyReact : is a builder for more advanced LazyFutureStreams
