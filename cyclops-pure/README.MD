# Cyclops Pure (Î») : The cyclops module for pure functional programming in Java

Cyclops pure provides support for advanced functional data structures and higher kinded type classes for a wide range of cyclops data types.

* control : advanced functional control structure such as
            Reader, Writer, State, ReaderWriterStrate, IO
* arrow : Kleisli arrow and related types
* free : free monad and related types
* kinds : Higher Kinded proxies for JDK types
* typeclasses :  interface definitions for many popular typeclasses
* instances : typeclass instances for cyclops and JDK data types
* transformers : monad transformer interface definitions
* hkt : Manager classes to make working with Higher Kinded typeclasses cleaner in Java

Since cyclops 10.0.0-M5
